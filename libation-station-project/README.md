### Introduction

- For our Unit 3 Lab we are going to get some practice in with React, building a Single Page Application that makes a call to a 3rd party API before we create our own Full Stack Apps for the project.
- You and your team will be making a call to the MealDB (https://themealdb.com/api.php) or to the CocktailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to pull recipes and render them to your screen
  

### Requirements

- A new Github Repo created for this project, with a .gitIgnore to prevent node_modules from being pushed up
- A React app connected to either DB using Axios, with useEffect and useState hooks used.
- A search bar that allows users to search by recipes
- At least 2 different pages linked through the React Router
- Professional, Clean, Modern style using Flexbox or Grid
- Project deployed through either Surge or Netlify



### Bonus

- Have multiple search options - Name, Ingredients, or anyting else available through either API
- Responsive styling to make the site Mobile friendly
- Anything else you can imagine!
